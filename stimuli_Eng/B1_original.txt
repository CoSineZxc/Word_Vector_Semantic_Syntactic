In a thick bamboo jungle,
two young pandas had started their new life.
Both of them were very cute and chubby.
They were born only a few days ago.
Their mother had lovingly christened them
Jackie and Mickey.
They were pretty young and weak.
The two pandas were not even big enough
to take care of themselves.
Therefore their mother said, "Kids,
you are growing now, you should be able
to differentiate between a friend and a foe."
"Mother, who are friends and foes?"
asked Jackie and Mickey.
"One who helps us and stands by us
in all our odds, is our friend.
And one who harms us and kills
innocent animals, is our enemy.
Do you understand?" she asked.
"Yes mother, we do understand.
We will maintain a safe distance from
our enemies and not even let them
come near us,¡± they assured her.
¡°Good, my children. I was expecting
the same understanding from both of you.
Now, I can leave you alone
as you have grown wise¡±
said their mother, and she gave
Jackie and Mickey a big hug.
The next day, Mother Panda
went to visit her sister. She left
Jackie and Mickey alone and went away.
All this while, a Hyena
was keeping an evil eye on Jackie
and Mickey. He was looking
for a right opportunity
for the past few days.
The Hyena's mouth watered when he
Saw the young and chubby pandas.
With their mother away, the Hyena
Found that much-awaited opportunity.
The Hyena came near the bamboo and said,
"Hello friends, what are you doing
on the bamboo. Come near me,
I will sing you a song and take
you both for a jungle-ride."
The pandas were surprised to hear the Hyena.
On seeing the dangerous-looking Hyena
Down below, Jackie whispered,
"The hyena cannot be our friend.
He has very big teeth!
Our mother had asked us to
stay away from enemies.
We have to be very careful and don't
have to go near the Hyena.¡±
On hearing what Jackie had to say, Mickey
cried aloud, "You wicked Hyena,
you are our enemy and you want
to eat us to satisfy your hunger.
We will never get down."
