Put his head through the hole,
but it was just too big.
Mr. Coyote¡¯s ears were in the way.
So he took off his ears and put them through the hole.
Mr. Coyote again tried his head,
But his eyes were too big.
Mr. Coyote took his eyes off
and put them through the hole.
Mr. Raven who was flying by,
saw the big blue eyes and flew
down to take them. Then
Mr. Raven flew back up high
in the tree with Mr. Coyote's eyes.
They were such beautiful eyes,
blue like the sky, and would be
a treasure to put in his hiding spot!
Mr. Coyote finally put his head
through the hole. He then
put himself back together.
One piece at a time he became
a whole coyote again.
But after he put his head on
he could not find his blue eyes.
Mr. Coyote was feeling all over.
His ears were listening to hear
him touch his eyes, but not
a sound could be heard from his eyes.
His fingers were being careful
while feeling around, but
still no eyes were found.
Mr. Coyote knew he could not let
the animals know he was blind.
He felt his way to a wild rose bush;
he then put two rose petals
in for his eyes. This would
cover the blindness for a little while,
but he would have to keep looking for
his eyes. Surely they were close by!
Along came Mr. Snail who saw
Mr. Coyote with the rose petals
in his eyes. He asked him,
"Mr. Coyote, why do you have
those rose petals in your eyes?"
Mr. Coyote said, "Because they are
beautiful. They have lovely colours.
You can try them if you want
and I will hold your eyes."
Mr. Snail took off his eyes.
He put them into Mr. Coyote's hands
and tried the rose petals in his eyes.
Then Mr. Coyote put Mr. Snail's
Eyes into his head and ran off.
To this day Mr. Snail is crawling
with his head down looking for his eyes.
And all coyotes have brown eyes
instead of blue; this is because
Mr. Coyote was naughty when he took
Mr. Snail's eyes. And Mr. Raven
still has those beautiful blue eyes,
in his very secret hiding place.
