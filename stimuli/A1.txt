Mr. Coyote was getting very old
and had to be more careful for his own safety.
He had been walking for hours and hours
through a beautiful valley, when he came
upon a very large tree.
Mr. Coyote was very tired
and wanted to rest but he
also needed to be safe.
He kindly asked the tree, "Please open up
so I can rest safely in your care".
The tree opened up so that Mr. Coyote
could go inside to rest,
then it closed to keep him safe.
Mr. Coyote slept for hours.
When he woke up he could not remember
what he had said to make the tree open.
He said, "Let me out Mr. Tree",
but nothing happened. He said,
"Please, let me out now!"
and again, nothing happened.
The tree did not even creak.
Mr. Coyote knocked on the tree,
but it would not open up.
Mr. Tree was upset with Mr. Coyote
for not having said please the first time.
It let him rest a little longer.
Because the birds heard Mr. Coyote
banging on the inside of the tree,
they came down to peck on the tree
to help get him out. But they
were too small and the tree was too big!
Finally, Mr. Woodpecker
came down and pecked a hole in the tree.
Although it was a very small hole,
it caused him to get a bent beak!
¡°Oh no! My beak!¡± cried
Mr. Woodpecker in pain.
This meant Mr. Woodpecker couldn't
peck on the tree anymore.
Mr. Coyote put one hand out the hole
but he could not fit through.
He then tried his leg, but
still he could not fit through.
He had to come up with a way to escape,
Since Mr. Woodpecker's beak was now bent.
Mr. Coyote knew there had to be a way.
"Ah, come on you old ugly tree,
Just let me out!¡± he cried.
But still, nothing happened.
Mr. Tree refused to open up.
Mr. Coyote decided to take off
his arms one at a time and
put them through the small hole.
He then put his legs through
one at a time by taking them off.
He put his body through by taking it off.
This was working out fine.
I'll show you Mr. Tree, you can't
keep me in here, he thought.
Next, Mr. Coyote tried to
